2. Usage:
In SML, type:
- CM.make("logic.cm");
	. . .
 	. . .
val it = true:bool

- Logic.compile("good.logic");

// it, of Abs.Program type gives the AST

- val a = it;
- use "Datatypes.sml";
- use "functions.sml";

// use any of the three functions
3. functions.sml contains the functions for finding the height, size of the tree, and also to output the set of variables in the tree

4. Datatypes.sml contains the Abstract datatype "Abs"

5. The remaining files (compiler.sml, logic.cm, glue.sml) have been taken from the reference provided on Moodle.

6. make cleans up the directory of any previous generated files. (.lex.sml, .yacc.sml .sig etc.)
